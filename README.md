# Overview

An all-on-one machine OpenStack cloud can be useful for development of OpenStack projects, OpenStack Charms, or for exercising and testing the same.

This repository provides resources and processes to support deployment of OpenStack in LXD containers using Juju, a powerful application modeling tool.

Such a process is useful in developer scenarios where OpenStack can be deployed to a single laptop or server, provided of course that enough resources are available.

These bundles, configurations and processes can be customized to fit numerous development or production scenarios.

For full details of use please refer the the [OpenStack on LXD](https://docs.openstack.org/charm-guide/latest/openstack-on-lxd.html) section of the [OpenStack Charm Guide](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/charm-guide).
